# Hello World

Setting up a blog here. I hope that I will be able to post regularly. I don't
know what all the content will be about. Probably technical in nature. Coding
related. Descriptions of side projects are good candidates, given that I have
time for them. Occasional book summaries. We'll see.

For now, the goal is to bring this blob post up. I am following the tutorial
for [Next.js](https://next.js) that describes building a blog post page.
I like the framework for far. I plan to use
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. I then hope to deploy to
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Then look into [Github
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automatic deploys when
pushing to master. Certificates for https will hopefully be easy enough to
acquire. At some point I also want to convert the code to
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Lots to do.

Back to coding now ;)
